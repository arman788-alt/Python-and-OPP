# Inheritance Class Polymorphism::
# What about classes with child classes with the same name? Can we use polymorphism there?

# Yes. If we use the example above and make a parent class called Vehicle, and make Car, Boat, Plane child classes of Vehicle, the child classes inherits the Vehicle methods,
# but can override them:

# Example
# Create a class called Vehicle and make Car, Boat, Plane child classes of Vehicle:


class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Move!")

class Car(Vehicle):
  pass

class Boat(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print("Sail!")

class Plane(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print("Fly!")

car1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang") #Create a Car object
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza", "Touring 20") #Create a Boat object
plane1 = Plane("Boeing", "747") #Create a Plane object

for x in (car1, boat1, plane1):
  x.move()
# Child classes inherits the properties and methods from the parent class.

# In the example above you can see that the Car class is empty, but it inherits brand, model, and move() from Vehicle.

# The Boat and Plane classes also inherit brand, model, and move() from Vehicle, 
# but they both override the move() method.

# Because of polymorphism we can execute the same method for all classes.
